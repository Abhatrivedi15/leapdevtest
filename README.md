# Leap QE Technical Test
Thanks for giving me opportunity to demonstrate my testing skills through this test. I have uploaded relevant documents regarding Task 1 and Task 2 in this GitHub repository. If any issues, please let me know. Thanks.

## Task 1
I have wrote test cases as requested in the test and have uploaded the excel document [here](https://github.com/Abhatrivedi15/leapdevtest/tree/master/Task%201). As requested in the technical test document, I have wrote all test cases relevant for Login, Book Store and Profile secions of the website.

## Task 2
I have used Postman tool to demonstrated API testing skill. I have uploaded the collection in this GitHub repo, under Task 2 folder. Please import it in Postman and view the collection. As part of this task, I have done following tasks.

1. In Postman collection, I have created separate folder to demonstrate Positive and Negative scenarios.

2. For CREATE and READ functions, I have done schema validation tests including both positive and negative scenarios.

3. To demonstrate data driven testing skill, I have uploaded test data file named "test_data_CREATE_function.json". This file is used to test CREATE function as shown in [this screenshot](https://github.com/Abhatrivedi15/leapdevtest/blob/master/Task%202/Data%20Driven%20Testing.png).

4. I have used "Flows" feature of postman to demonstrate chain requests i.e. extract data from one endpoint and pass it to another endpoint. Postman doesn't allow exporting of Flows, but if you want to have a look please let me know and I am happy to share my Postman workspace. Please find the [sample video here](https://github.com/Abhatrivedi15/leapdevtest/blob/master/Task%202/Chain%20Request%20Testing.mov) demonstrating chain requests that I have created. Happy to share my Postman workspace with you if you want to have a look.

5. Have created all CRUD mandatory endpoints.

### How to test Postman Collection
The collection is made in generic way. If host, key or resource (i.e. Employee) changes, you can update this information at one place rather than going to individual endpoints. After getting Key from [https://crudcrud.com/](https://crudcrud.com/), please go through following steps to update key:

1. Click on "Leap QE Technical Test" Collection

2. Click on "Variables" menu item

3. There you will see three variables (host, key and resource). Please update key in this section.
